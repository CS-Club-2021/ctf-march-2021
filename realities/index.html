        Dr. Strange : It’s a complete mess now. I can see every single timeline all at once, but there is no way I can pinpoint our reality again.
        Wong : Our string of reality looks impossible to find! This is really a terminal situation.
        Dr Strange : Get a grep on yourself! In that case, we’ll let you the player, wisest of the wise, find it out.
